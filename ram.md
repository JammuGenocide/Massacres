One of the most compelling interviews conducted in Sialkot was with Hussein Gujrar, who migrated from Ram Nagar to Sialkot in October 1947. He was 18 at 
the time and now is a resident of Tarowali mohalla of Sialkot. He still remembers the events of that period vividly when all the members of his family 
was massacred. He recalls:
````

````
"I was about 18 years old at time. One night, the Dogra troopers attacked our home and killed my parents, sister and two younger brothers. 
Luckily, I was not at home that night so remained safe. The next morning when I reached home I saw everywhere bodies and blood. They [the army of the Maharajah] 
looted everything from the home... I walked from Jammu to Sialkot carrying just one handbag."
