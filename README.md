**The massacre of Muslims of Jammu City 5, November 1947**

Here is a factual report jointly submitted by two foreigners who visited the subcontinent and were commissioned for this purpose by the Governments of India and Pakistan:—

      "On the morning of November 5, it was announced by beat of drum in Jammu city, in the name of 
      His Highness the Maharaja, that all Muslims must immediately leave the State and that, in fact, 
      Pakistan had asked for them. They were instructed to assemble at the parade ground in Jammu.
      Conducted from there to the police lines, they were searched, deprived of most of their belongings
      and loaded on motor lorry convoys. They were told they would be sent to Suchetgarh but instead the 
      convoys took the Kathua Road and halted at Mawa, where the passengers were told to get down.”

      "At Mawa, the lorry drivers, who were Sikhs and armed to the teeth, removed all the young women from the
      convoys and began to attack the remainder. The Kashmir State troops looked on indifferently while the mobs
      of Sikhs and Hindus were killing the Muslims.
      
      "Out of the four thousand Muslims, who had left Jammu, only nine hundred managed to reach Sialkot, in Pakistan. 
      
      
**The massacre of Muslims of Jammu City 6, November 1947**


      "A convoy of seventy trucks, containing most of the respectable Muslim families of Jammu city 
      left for Suchetgarh on November 6. A few miles out of the city, the trucks were halted and were
      attacked by armed jathas of Sikhs and State troops and volunteers of the Rashtrya Swayam Sewak Sangh. 


**Massacre of Sambha**

      "During the beginning of October 1947, about fourteen thousand Muslims living in Sambha were besieged by 
      armed Hindus and Sikhs, who cut off the rations and watersupply of the villages. On October 23, Sambha
      village was visited by His Highness the Maharaja himself, and almost immediately after his visit, all the
      Muslim women in the village were taken away by State troops, and the men were slaughtered with the exception
      of fifteen survivors, who escaped to Sialkot. About eight thousand Muslims assembled at the Bulla Tank near 
      Kathua on October 20, after their request for protection had been ignored by the sub-divisional magistrate of
      Kathua. After marching three miles towards the Pakistan border, they were encircled by Dogra troops and armed 
      Sikh civilians, and all of them were slaughtered with the exception of forty persons, who managed to escape to
      Sialkot."

**Masacre at Maogaon**

      "On the instructions of the State Government, about twenty-five thousand Muslims from Miran Sahib area collected at 
      Maogaon to be evacuated to Pakistan. But as they were doing so, their women and all their personal belongings were 
      taken away from them by Dogra troops, and the rest made to stand in a line, whereupon they were riddled with machine-gun 
      bullets. Only one hundred of them escaped, hiding in maize fields."
