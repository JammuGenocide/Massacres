**Before the Maharaja's arrival:**

    A convoy of Muslim refugees which had come from the interior of Kathua and had swelled into numbers while advancing towards the borders reached there. 
    The army compelled them to pass through the Hindu mob; on reaching there, one of the officers ordered the mob to "send them to Pakistan". Upon this, 
    the Dogra soldiers and armed goondas attacked them amidst the Dogra war cry of 'Maharaja Bahadur Ki Jail. It is claimed that not many were able to escape
    alive. On the next day, the Maharaja and the Prime Minister visited the town and congratulated their followers for their "performance".

    Another convoy of nearly twelve thousand Muslims left Kathua for Pakistan after their failure to secure protection. Two miles from Pakistan border at 
    village Khasyal a mob comprising Dogra soldiers and Sanghis fell upon them with rifles and swords. Similarly, a convoy of two thousand Muslims which left
    village Bandore was attacked at Chhati Khoi, about three miles from the Pakistan border. A convoy of about 7000 Muslims left Chani Rodoon for Pakistan;
    it was attacked at Heera Nagar.

**A convoy of 500 Muslims:**

    A convoy had left Kohatah, none of whom is claimed to have been able to enter Pakistan. A convoy of 3000 Muslims from Budhi and Tala Mola which left for 
    Pakistan, was attacked at Mahi Chak. A convoy of about six thousand Muslims left Nagri, Runb and Chhatta villages for Pakistan, but was attacked at 
    Khikhiyan. Muslims from villages Sallni, Hiranagar, Candi etc. gathered at Hiranagar and left for Pakistan. They were stopped by the army at some 
    distance and told to hand over their cash and ornaments in exchange for a guarantee to be escorted to Pakistan borders. After receiving a large number 
    of ornaments and cash, the convoy was allowed to proceed and an escort was also provided, but when they reached Chhati Khoi, a soldier opened fire and 
    instantly Sanghis who had already taken positions before their arrival as they seemed to have been briefed in advance, attacked the convoy. These goondas
    also had a brengun. A convoy of two thousand Muslims from Rajpura and Kagowal left for Pakistan, but was attacked in the way. In Samba town, about ten 
    thousand Muslims from the town and its suburbs collected for migration to Pakistan. Most of the male were invited to the town- pond on the pretext of 
    forming a Peace Committee, but there they were surrounded by armed bands and in their absence, young girls from their homes were abducted. 
    There is no doubt that a large number of Muslims, men, women and children were killed each time.
