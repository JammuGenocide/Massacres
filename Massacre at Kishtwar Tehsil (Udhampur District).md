**Kishtwar Tehsil (Udhampur District)**

    Kishtwar lo 69 miles from Batote and the illaqa is mostly inhabited by
    Muslims except the Paddar valley of Hindu Thakars. The Muslim population
    was not more than 3001400. The place being very far off, it was affected last
    of all when the Bhadanvahis infiltrated there and caused disturbances in the
    Nunjwah area, as a result of which some villages were destroyed and all the
    Muslim police men posted at the Paddar mines were done to death. Some
    locals from Paddar ran to Kishtwar and were saved. Bodh Raj Bali, Sub
    Inspector Police, Kali Dass Zaildar, Paddar, and the Hindu Nafri at Paddar
    was mainly responsible for this tragedy. Tek Chand Munsiff headed the raids.


    He was assisted by Shiv Dass Mengi, Divisional Forest 0fficer;and the local
    Mehtas. Although the Muslims had caught Hindu boys carrying swords, no
    action was taken by the tehsildar. The tehsildar did not take any interest in
    the supply of rice or maize to the Muslims as the tehsil is deficient in food
    grains and depends mainly upon Bhadarwah (Bhales illaqa) on one side and
    Anantnag tehsil (Kashmir) G~I the other.
