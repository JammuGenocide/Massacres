***Massacres of Sambha***

  ```
  Early October 1947:

  About 14,000 Muslims living in Sambha were besieged by armed Hindus and Sikhs, who cut off the rations and watersupply of the villages.

  On October 23:

  Sambha village was visited by His Highness the Maharaja himself, and almost immediately after his visit, all the Muslim women in the village were taken away by State troops, and the men were slaughtered with the exception of fifteen survivors, who escaped to Sialkot. About eight thousand Muslims assembled at the Bulla Tank near Kathua on October 20, after their request for protection had been ignored by the sub-divisional magistrate of Kathua.

  After marching three miles towards the Pakistan border, they were encircled by Dogra troops and armed Sikh civilians, and all of them were slaughtered with the exception of forty persons, who managed to escape to Sialkot.

  The words of the Second master of the Samba High School who was one of the passengers:
  "Among them were my old parents, three brothers, two sons and two daughters. The trucks started at 2 p.m. At Satwari Cantonment we found Hindus and Sikhs assembled on both sides of the road and armed to the teeth. Muslims got extremely worried and each one of us thought that we were no longer safe. Some youth tried to save themselves by jumping down from the trucks but where could they go? They were killed on the spot. The drivers then diverted the trucks towards Kathua road and accelerated the speed. It was time for evening prayers when four trucks were stopped near the town of Samba. As soon as we came down, we were surrounded and taken to a ground where we were made to sit. First of all, women were separated from us. On two sides of the ground stood a hill, on the third side were the trucks, while only one side was open, but on this side we found soldiers with fixed machine-guns; so there was no side left for us to run away. The assailants had been divided into six or seven groups.

  Those who had surrounded us were armed with rifles, spears, swords and birchas. Those who snatched away ornaments, money, beddings and other property, consisted mostly of Ahhuts; a third group was taking possession of women and in overall charge were officers who issued orders. The Satanic arrangements were so complete and the workers so trained which left no doubt that they had been trained over a considerable period of time. The victims were then removed to the butchery in a group of six persons each. I put off my shoes and ran away and though fired at, was able to save my life but my old parents, brothers, sons and daughters who had boarded the trucks with myself, I have not heard of them since then."
