**Carnage in the Streets of Jammu and Kathua**
      
      The situation in Jammu city and its surroundings was extremely
      precarious, even by the middle. of August. On my visit to Srinagar from
      Peshawar, I left via Banihal, but had to return back from Batote as I learnt
      from Muslims coming from the city that it was absolutely unsafe to leave for
      Pakistan via Suchetgarh. The influx of non-muslim refugees in Jammu city
      increased after the 14th of August. The Committee officially entrusted with
      the task of making arrangements for their stay was headed by Pandit Prem
      Nath Dogra, a retired SDM who will figure prominently in some of the later
      events. By that time, harassment of Muslims had already begun, especially in
      the border areas, with the result that two thousand Muslims had, by the 10th
      of October, already migrated to Sialkot. The border had been sealed and no
      Muslim was allowed entry into the State. In order to ascertain the condition of
      Muslims in the area and check their influx into Pakistan, Brigadier Collier, an
      English officer, Commanding Sialkot Sector, contacted Brigadier Rawat, his
      counter-part in Jammu on the suggestion of Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din, then
      Minister for Rehabilitation West Punjab Government, for permission to visit
      Jammu, which was refused.
      
      
      In Jammu city itself, centres for the training of Hindus in the use of
      fire-arms were set up in Vaid Mandir, Raghu Nath Mandir, Talab Rani, Pacca
      Danga and Gurdawara Pacci Dhakki which were manned by retired Military
      officers. It is heartening to note that there were still some good-natured
      Hindus like Bankay Behari, Nand Lal Pawa, Chattru Das and Dr. Sethi who
      cautioned their Muslim friends, like Ch. Allah Ditta and Dr. Abdul Karim, of
      the grim shape of things to come. All ex-soldiers and other trained personnel
      were issued each, a 303 rifle with 50 rounds of ammunition. The border with
      Pakistan Was sealed. The massacre Was then begun from Samba and
      Kathua The technique was identical which showed their common origin. 
      was to surround a particular village near the border, start firing and killing at
      random to terrify its Muslim inhabitants who Were compelled to flee towards
      Jammu city. The primary aim was to finish the youth of the community. A
      number of women were always abducted and property looted away. While on
      their way to Jammu city, the process of killing, plunder and abduction was
      at several points. It is claimed that Hari Singh himself initiated these
      killings at Deva Vatala which had a large population of Dogras.
