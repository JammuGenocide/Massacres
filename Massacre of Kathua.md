**Carnage in the Streets of Jammu and Kathua**
      
      The situation in Jammu city and its surroundings was extremely
      precarious, even by the middle. of August. On my visit to Srinagar from
      Peshawar, I left via Banihal, but had to return back from Batote as I learnt
      from Muslims coming from the city that it was absolutely unsafe to leave for
      Pakistan via Suchetgarh. The influx of non-muslim refugees in Jammu city
      increased after the 14th of August. The Committee officially entrusted with
      the task of making arrangements for their stay was headed by Pandit Prem
      Nath Dogra, a retired SDM who will figure prominently in some of the later
      events. By that time, harassment of Muslims had already begun, especially in
      the border areas, with the result that two thousand Muslims had, by the 10th
      of October, already migrated to Sialkot. The border had been sealed and no
      Muslim was allowed entry into the State. In order to ascertain the condition of
      Muslims in the area and check their influx into Pakistan, Brigadier Collier, an
      English officer, Commanding Sialkot Sector, contacted Brigadier Rawat, his
      counter-part in Jammu on the suggestion of Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din, then
      Minister for Rehabilitation West Punjab Government, for permission to visit
      Jammu, which was refused.
      
      
      In Jammu city itself, centres for the training of Hindus in the use of
      fire-arms were set up in Vaid Mandir, Raghu Nath Mandir, Talab Rani, Pacca
      Danga and Gurdawara Pacci Dhakki which were manned by retired Military
      officers. It is heartening to note that there were still some good-natured
      Hindus like Bankay Behari, Nand Lal Pawa, Chattru Das and Dr. Sethi who
      cautioned their Muslim friends, like Ch. Allah Ditta and Dr. Abdul Karim, of
      the grim shape of things to come. All ex-soldiers and other trained personnel
      were issued each, a 303 rifle with 50 rounds of ammunition. The border with
      Pakistan Was sealed. The massacre Was then begun from Samba and
      Kathua The technique was identical which showed their common origin. 
      was to surround a particular village near the border, start firing and killing at
      random to terrify its Muslim inhabitants who Were compelled to flee towards
      Jammu city. The primary aim was to finish the youth of the community. A
      number of women were always abducted and property looted away. While on
      their way to Jammu city, the process of killing, plunder and abduction was
      at several points. It is claimed that Hari Singh himself initiated these
      killings at Deva Vatala which had a large population of Dogras.
      
      
      On 20th October, about fifteen thousand Muslims from Akhnoor and
      its adjoining areas on being forced to leave for Pakistan, gathered in the
      vicinity of the town and were led towards the Akhnoor bridge where Dogra
      soldiers opened fire, killing9 large number. It is claimed that the killing was
      so extensive that blood actually flowed on the bridge. On the same day
      several attacks were launched on Muslims in Kathua district resulting in
      considerable deaths. On 23rd October, Dogra soldiers and Sanghis opened
      fire on a large crowd of Muslims, several thousand strong, in Miran Sahib
      Jammu. On the 21st of October, a large crowd of Rajputs, some of whom
      were armed with deadly weapons, were waiting at Rajpura which is midway
      between Jammu and Kathua to receive the Maharaja who was on tour,
      personally watching the execution of the genocide plan and lending
      encouragement to armed gangs engaged in the task and also providing arms
      2nd ammunition wherever needed. He was accompanied among others by
      his Prime Minister Mr. Justice ~ahajan.' As a humble member of the judicial
      service, I have to hang my head in shame to record that a Judge of Mr.
      Mahajan's abilities should have participated in the genocide of people and
      helped not only in its plannirlg but also its execution. While the crowd was
      still waiting, the armed among them had been formed into three lines, the
      front one consisted of those having rifles while in the second row were those
      who had other deadly weapons. Among the officers on the spot were an
      A.S.P., an Assistant Engineer, a Telegraph Supervisor and the S.D.M. There
      were also several Army officers of lesser rank. Before the Maharaja's arrival,
      a convoy of Muslim refugees which had come from the interior of Kathua and
      had swelled into numbers while advancing towards the borders reached
      there. The army compelled them to pass through the Hindu mob; on reaching
      there, one of the officers ordered the mob to "send them to Pakistan". Upon
      this, the Dogra soldiers and armed goondas attacked them amidst the Dogra
      war cry of 'Maharaja Bahadur Ki Jail. It is claimed that not many were able to
      escape alive. On the next day, the Maharaja and the Prime Minister visited
      the town and congratulated their followers for their "performance". Another
      convoy of nearly twelve thousand Muslims left Kathua for Pakistan after their
      failure to secure protection. Two miles from Pakistan border at village
      Khasyal a mob comprising Dogra soldiers and Sanghis fell upon them with
      rifles and swords. Similarly, a convoy of two thousand Muslims which left
      village Bandore was attacked at Chhati Khoi, about three miles from the
      Pakistan border. A convoy of about 7000 Muslims left Chani Rodoon for
      Pakistan; it was attacked at Heera Nagar. A convoy of 500 Muslims left
      Kohatah, none of whom is claimed to have been able to enter Pakistan. A
      convoy of 3000 Muslims from Budhi and Tala Mola which left for Pakistan,
      was attacked at Mahi Chak. A convoy of about six thousand Muslims left
      Nagri, Runb and Chhatta villages for Pakistan, but was attacked at
      Khikhiyan. Muslims from villages Sallni, Hiranagar, Candi etc. gathered at
      Hiranagar and left for Pakistan. They were stopped by the army at some
      distance and told to hand over their cash and ornaments in exchange for a
      guarantee to be escorted to Pakistan borders. After receiving a large number
      of ornaments and cash, the convoy was allowed to proceed and an escort
      was also provided, but when they reached Chhati Khoi, a soldier opened fire
      and instantly Sanghis who had already taken positions before their arrival as
      they seemed to have been briefed in advance, attacked the convoy. These
      goondas also had a brengun. A convoy of two thousand Muslims from
      Rajpura and Kagowal left for Pakistan, but was attacked in the way. In
      Samba town, about ten thousand Muslims from the town and its suburbs
      collected for migration to Pakistan. Most of the male were invited to the town-
      pond on the pretext of forming a Peace Committee, but there they were
      surrounded by armed bands and in their absence, young girls from their
      homes were abducted. There is no doubt that a large number of Muslims,
      men, women and children were killed each time.
