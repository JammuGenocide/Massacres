**The Massacre at Reasi**

    Reasi is 45 miles from Jammu. Chenab flows on three sides of the
    town. The left bank illaqa of the tehsil has a Hindu majority and Katra is a
    well-known town at the foot of the Vaishnu Devi hill. Reasi. Katra. Manthal
    and Tikri had been the main centres of Sangh activities. Kali DW, Rikhi sh,
    shubh Dutt, Dina Nath, retired Ranger, Shambu Nath son of Gana
    Ram, Minister, were its main pillars at Katra. Govardhan Singh, Wazir-1-
    Wazarat, Jia Lal Darbari A.S.P. and Manohar Lal S.I. Police played an active
    role in organising a militia company headed by Capt. Kishan Singh, Capt.
    Omkar Singh of Bijepur and retired Zaildar of Biddha. The Sangh at Katra
    was assisted by the party of lnder Singh Namdar of the Militia company.
    Reasi sustained the highest percentage of ~OSS of life. The illaqa towards the
    right bank of the Chenab was somehow saved because Muslims received
    timely information and the Arnas people ran up towards the Gool side, some
    of whom made their way towards Rajauri and then to Pakistan and some
    slipped away towards the adjoining Kashmir territory. All the Government
    employees were killed. Permanand Naib tehsildar Arnas (Gool) was
    instrumental in blocking the roads leading to Gool. Pauni town was also
    raided and the Sanghis went up to Paurakotla.
    
        On 4th November, 1947, a lorry load of Dogra troops from Jammu
    alighted near a nullah about one and a half mile from Reasi town. Some
    Muslim passers-by brought the information to the town. The news was
    disquieting because it was already known that the Dogra army was engaged
    in the killing of Muslims in other areas. A Peace Committee consisting of
    Hindus and Muslims had been set up a few days earlier to maintain what was
    termed as "communal harmony". So, Khawaja Amkalla, Rais and Khawaja
    Aziz Din, better known as Chaudhri Aziz Din, the most respected leaders of
    their community in the town, went to the residence of the Sub Divisional
    Magistrate, Thakar Govardan Singh, a Dogra, to enquire as to why had the
    Army been sent for, when a Peace Committee was already working
    effectively and no untoward incident had taken place. As soon as the two
    elders entered the main gate of the Magistrate's residence, their heads were
    most brutally chopped off. The news spread panic in the town. At 2.30 P.M.
    the Dogra troops who had, meanwhile, taken up positions in Hindu houses.
    started indiscriminate firing. Most of the Muslims thereupon took refuge in the
    Haveli of Mian Nizam-ud-Din. Sultan Muzaffar-ud-Din, Sub-Judge, who went
    to see them was killed by R.S.S volunteers. It was a signal for a general
    attack by the Sanghis led by the Dogra garrison. This happened on the 5th
    and continued up to the 6th of November. Many Muslims including women
    and children were killed and young Muslim women abducted. Some Muslims
    were taken to the Court premises - the place where Maharaja Pratap Singh
    was born and where a plaque had been installed to commemorate the event.
    Most of them were killed over there. The daughter-in-law of Maulvi Ghulam
    Haider Khan, father-in-law of Mr. Abdul Aziz Salehria, later Director
    Education, Azad Kashmir, was found murdered in her house along with her
    dead infant child, lying on her breast. Khawaja Ghulam Ali. P.S.1. who
    belonged to Bhadarwah and was posted here, succeeded in escaping from
    
    the clutches of the murderous gangs and reached the Police Station, only to
    be handed back by his colleagues and subordinates to the R.S.S. goondas,
    who killed him by inches by cutting a limb and after enjoying the spectacle of
    his pain and agony for some time, then proseeded to chop off another limb
    and so on. According to Malik Abdur Rashid, a resident of the town, and
    Director Village Aid Azad Kashmir who furnished these facts to me, about
    three to four thousand Muslims were killed in the district. Thakar Govardan
    Singh was later arrested under orders of Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah and
    put in Jammu Jail. It is not known what happened to him later. He was the
    son-in-law of General Janak Singh.
    Rajauri is about 70 miles from Reasi. The Hindus who were mostly
    money-lenders had removed most of their valuables. This being a Muslim
    majority area, the Government had already detailed a company to Rajauri
    proper. With the start of the genocide, one more company was sent from
    Reasi to first "clear" the Pauni Bharakh illaqa and, after passing through
    Dharamsal Sialsui, reach Rajauri but it was through sheer good-luck that the
    Wazir ordered them to proceed to Arnas in Gool illaqa and it was after the fall
    of Rajauri that the mistake came to light. The tehsildar, Harjilal, ran away to
    Jammu along with some military personnel. Things would have been quite
    bad if the above reinforcement had arrived there.
